## Installation Steps


So let's get started first of all open our browser and search for docker.
From here we can click this link [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) which is going to redirect us to the downloads page.

But before that let's see what are the system requirements for downloading this application so we can see here for installing docker on our windows operating system we need to have at least all of these requirements.

If we get any errors after installing docker, then we should install this WSL command first in order to run the docker desktop.

Then, click this button which says download from docker hub and here we will see this web page first. 
So first of all we need to create a docker id if we haven't already have a docker id we can just click on this sign up link here which will open this kind of web page and here we can create our docker account which requires a docker id, email address and password and we need to just agree these terms and conditions.

So once we have our docker id just sign into our docker account which is going to redirect us to this page.

To check if our windows already have docker or not, we get to know by checking the docker version.

In docker, we wil be able to see all the images that related to deploy this project.
