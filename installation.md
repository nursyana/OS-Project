## Installation Steps


So let's get started first of all open your browser and search for docker.
From here you can click this link [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) which is going to redirect you to the downloads page.

But before that let's see what are the system requirements for downloading this application so as you can see here for installing docker on your windows operating system you need to have at least all of these requirements.

If you get any errors after installing docker, then you should instal this WSL command first in order to run the docker desktop.

Then, click this button which says download from docker hub and here you will see this web page first. 
So first of all you need to create a docker id if you haven't already have a docker id you can just click on this sign up link here which will open this kind of web page and here you can create your docker account which requires a docker id, email address and password and you need to just agree these terms and conditions.

So once you have your docker id just sign into your docker account which is going to redirect you to this page.

To check if your windows already have docker or not, you get to know by checking the docker version.

In docker, we wil be able to see all the images that related to deploy this project.
